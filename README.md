## This is an ongoing project (hopefully :D ) where i will continuously improve and learn about golang and it's packages
* [install golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) 
* run `go get .`
* create a Postgresql database
* add the info in a `.env` file (example inside .env.local)
* run `go run main.go`


## TODO:
1- complete all needed CRUD (~~projects still missing PATCH endpoint~~)

2- Protect sensitive endpoints (POST - PATCH - DELETE) using an auth middleware (JWT ?)

3- Add swagger docs definition

4- explore GraphQL and implement it

5- TBD
